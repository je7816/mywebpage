<h4>
Art, in its broadest sense, is a form of communication. It means whatever the artist intends it to mean, and this meaning is shaped by the materials, techniques, and forms it makes
use of, as well as the ideas and feelings it creates in its viewers . Art is an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.

<h4>
 Art provides a means to express the imagination (things, places, ideas that are unreal or unknowable) in nongrammatic ways. Unlike words, which come in sequences,
 each of which has a definite meaning,art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that can be determined by the artist.
