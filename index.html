<h4>
Art, in its broadest sense, is a form of communication. It means whatever the artist intends it to mean, and this meaning is shaped by the materials, techniques, and forms it 
makes use of, as well as the ideas and feelings it creates in its viewers . Art is an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.
</h4>
      
<h4>
 Art provides a means to express the imagination (things, places, ideas that are unreal or unknowable) in nongrammatic ways. Unlike words, which come in sequences,
 each of which has a definite meaning,art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that can be determined by the artist.
</h4>
      
<h4>Art forces humans to look beyond that which is necessary to survive and leads people to create for the sake of expression and meaning.
    Art can communicate information, shape our everyday lives, make a social statement and be enjoyed for aesthetic beauty.</h4>
      
      
<h4>There are countless forms of art. When it comes to visual arts, there are generally 3 types: decorative, commercial, and fine art.
      The broader definition of “the arts” covers everything from painting through theatre, music, architecture,and more.</h4>
    
      
<h4>Art is a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product,that involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power,
      or conceptual ideas.There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, and ideas have changed over time.</h4>
